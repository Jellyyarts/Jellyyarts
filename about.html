                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My name is Jellyyarts or for short Jellyy (creative mix as a username I know). <br> <br> I am currently in college trying to get an assocciates in graphic design to work for companies or do commissions for illustrations and logos alike.</p>

                <h3>A little background</h3>
                <p>I started working with art around 6 or 7 years ago in middle school, I've improved drastically since then though. <br> <br> I have started to research more about anatomy and shading than when I first started and simply wanted to make things. <br> <br> A reason why I'm still drawing is because I like to make scenarios or stories for characters that I like.</p>

                <h3>How I draw</h3>
                <p>The best and easiest way I've found to draw is by making either small doodles in my sketchbook or spend full hours on my laptop working on a single drawing that will never see the sun again. <br> <br> Usually I draw digitally on Photoshop and Ibis Paint X but occasionally make some other drawings or doodles in my sketchbook and have worked on a few projects for Adobe programs while doing certification courses for them.</p>

            <div id="commissions">
                <h3>Commissions</h3>
                <p>Currently I am not doing commissions full time, right now I just do suggestions or work for free for friends or as practice until I’m confident enough to price my work. <br> <br> If you'd like you can still commission or ask me to draw something with the button below! <br> <br> Just make sure to remember that if it's simply practice it will take me longer while commissions will be done over a shorter period of time and I will strive for perfection.</p>

                <div id="direction">
                <h3>Direction</h3>
                <p>Right now I'm not sure what I will do, but the plan is to do some freelance jobs as either a designer or a photographer and do commissions for anyone that asks. <br> <br> I do not know if i will able to make a job or income out of my experience but it is worth giving a shot!</p>
